So, originally micro-site for Code4Nation's first hackathon is maintained by
@sabarr and his friends at Tech in Asia, using Wordpress. So there will be
traces of their design here and there. By the way, thank you!

Now we are confident that it will be best to have static website and to open the
contribution from all of you, we are moving to Github Pages.
